# Features

Start with of 140,000 images
initial organisation is 1000 images per microfilm reel
Not an archival structure - a collection of images
Each reel is not an item in the sense defined above

One of the goals of the project is to crowdsource an archive out of these images.
E.g., a reel might contain letters, photographs, documents.
An item may span several images.
An item could start on one reel and finish on another (confirm?)

In its initial state we just have the images and their microfilm metadata
 (link to analysis of current data)

This is not an archive of distinct items; they do not yet make sense as: 
 - CHO to export to DPLA
 - IIIF manifest to drive viewer (the only organisational stucture at the start is per reel, it does not make sense to present the archive as 140 manifests each of 1000 images with no internal structure.
 - separate objects in Omeka
