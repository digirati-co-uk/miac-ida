			<p>The <strong>Indigenous Digital Archive</strong> is here to help you explore the history of US government Indian boarding schools in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
			<p>We'd encourage you to join the community to help annotate, research, organise, and even recontextualise these historical documents. Please review our <a href="code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> if you are interested.</p>
